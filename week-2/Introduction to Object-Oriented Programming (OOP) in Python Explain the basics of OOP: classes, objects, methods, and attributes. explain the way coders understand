 Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that uses "objects" to represent data and methods to manipulate that data. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the core concepts:

1. Classes
Definition: A class is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines a set of attributes and methods that the created objects will have. 
Example:

class Car:
    def __init__(self, make, model):
        self.make = make
        self.model = model
    
    def display_info(self):
        return f"{self.make} {self.model}"

my_car = Car("Toyota", "Corolla")
print(my_car.display_info())  

# Output: Toyota Corolla

2. Objects
Definition: An object is an instance of a class. It contains actual data and can use the methods defined in its class.
Example:
my_dog = Dog("Buddy", "Golden Retriever")
Here, my_dog is an object of the Dog class with the name "Buddy" and breed "Golden Retriever".


3. Attributes
Definition: Attributes are variables that belong to a class or an object. They hold data related to the object.
Example:
print(my_dog.name) 
 
# Output: Buddy

The attribute name holds the value "Buddy" for the my_dog object.

4. Methods
Definition: Methods are functions defined within a class that describe the behaviors of the objects created from the class. They can manipulate the object's attributes.
Example:
class Dog:
    def __init__(self, name, breed):
        self.name = name
        self.breed = breed
    
    def bark(self):
        return f"{self.name} says Woof!"

my_dog = Dog("Buddy", "Golden Retriever")
print(my_dog.bark()) 

 # Output: Buddy says Woof!

In this example, bark is a method that allows the my_dog object to perform an action.

Summary
Classes are blueprints for creating objects.
Objects are instances of classes that hold specific data.
Attributes are the data stored in an object.
Methods are functions that define behaviors for the object.
