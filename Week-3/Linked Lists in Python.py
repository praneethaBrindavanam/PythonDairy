Linked Lists in Python
A Linked List is a linear data structure where elements (called nodes) are stored in a sequence, but not in contiguous memory locations. Each node contains:

Data: The actual value or data of the node.
Pointer: A reference (or link) to the next node in the list.
There are two main types of linked lists:

Singly Linked List
Doubly Linked List
