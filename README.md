 3: Python Syntax and Variables
Explain Python’s simple syntax, variables, and basic data types (strings, integers, floats).

 4: Control Flow in Python (if-else, loops)
Write about control flow in Python using if-else, for loops, and while loops with examples.

 5: Functions in Python
Explain functions, how to define and call them, parameters, return values, and the importance of modular code.

 6: Python Data Structures Part 1: Lists and Tuples
Dive into Python lists and tuples, with examples of how and when to use them.

 7: Python Data Structures Part 2: Dictionaries and Sets
Explain dictionaries and sets, showing examples of their use cases.


Week 2: Python Intermediate Concepts

 8: File Handling in Python
How to read from and write to files in Python, and practical use cases like logs or saving results.

 9: Error and Exception Handling
Write about handling errors and exceptions in Python using try-except blocks, and why they’re important.

 10: Working with Modules and Libraries
Explain how to import Python libraries and use built-in modules like math, os, etc.

 11: Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python
Explain the basics of OOP: classes, objects, methods, and attributes.

 12: OOP Concepts: Inheritance and Polymorphism
Go deeper into OOP by explaining inheritance and polymorphism with examples.

 13: Python Packages: How to Create and Use Them
Explain how to create Python packages, and install third-party packages using pip.

14: Python Libraries for Data Science (NumPy, Pandas)
Introduce NumPy and Pandas, two popular libraries for data manipulation, and provide simple examples.

Week 3: Data Structures & Algorithms

15: Introduction to Data Structures in Python
Brief introduction to common data structures (arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs) and their importance.

 16: Arrays in Python
Write about array structures, how they differ from lists, and basic array operations in Python.

 17: Linked Lists in Python
Explain the concept of linked lists (singly and doubly linked), their operations, and use cases.

 18: Stacks and Queues in Python
Discuss stacks (LIFO) and queues (FIFO), showing practical examples and implementations.

 19: Trees in Python (Binary Trees, Binary Search Trees)
Explain the concept of trees, with examples of binary trees and binary search trees.

 20: Hash Tables and Hashing
Write about hash tables, their usage, and how Python dictionaries are implemented using hashing.

 21: Introduction to Algorithms and Complexity Analysis
Explain algorithm complexity (Big O notation) and why it’s important to evaluate algorithm performance.

Week 4: Advanced Topics & Mini-Projects

 22: Sorting Algorithms in Python (Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort)
Write about different sorting algorithms, their implementations, and time complexity.

 23: Searching Algorithms in Python (Linear Search, Binary Search)
Explain searching algorithms, when to use them, and their performance.

 24: Recursion in Python
Dive into recursion, with examples like calculating factorial, Fibonacci series, and solving problems with recursive solutions.

 25: Dynamic Programming Concepts
Introduce dynamic programming (memoization and tabulation) with examples like the Knapsack problem.

   26: APIs and API Integration in Python
         Explain what APIs are, how to integrate APIs using Python’s requests library, and showcase a                 simple project (like fetching weather data).

 27: Web Scraping with Python (BeautifulSoup, Scrapy)
       Write about web scraping, the legality of scraping, and provide an example of how to extract data           from a website.

 28: Building a Simple Web App with Flask
       Provide a step-by-step guide to building a basic web application using Flask.

 29: Testing in Python (Unit Tests, Integration Tests)

 30:Combinbing all these and doing a mini Project
      Explain the importance of testing in software development, and how to write unit tests in Python
